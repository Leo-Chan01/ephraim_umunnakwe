DO NOT USE GRADIENTS
AVOID TOO MUCH SHADOWS
REPLACE EMOJI WITH ACTUAL ICONS
MAKE SURE EVERY PAGE PRESENT AND PAST SUPPORTS BOTH DARK AND LIGHT MODES AND PROPERLY FOLLOWS THE THEMING

These below are my site colors:
#0C2B4E
#1A3D64
#1D546C
#F4F4F4

I want to be able to change colors from a single place stop using raw color and theme definitions, it's dumb and doesn't make sense. Do not use any other colors outside this paelletts. configure and stricly follow this branding. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS.
